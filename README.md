<b>Blast Into Space\
I programmed an interactive game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, in which the user can control a spaceship with their keyboard to navigate and avoid asteroids, with the aim of winning the game. The goal of the game is to survive the increasing speed of the asteroids as time progresses. The player loses the game when they collide with an asteroid. Periodically, power-ups randomly appear on the screen where the player must maneuver the spaceship to collide with the shield for temporary protection from asteroids until a collision occurs.
Users have the ability to control the volume of the game and adjust its difficulty, with options for easy, normal, and hard modes. The difficulty setting dynamically adjusts the speed of the asteroids to provide different levels of challenge to the users.
